</span></span>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: monospace;">Fly-By-Night (FBN)
is
based on a n-tier J2EE based distributed enterprise application
architecture.
It is designed to satisfy all functional and non-functional
requirements. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: monospace;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: monospace;">Trade-offs had to
be
made and QoS requirements had to be prioritized. Performance was
prioritized over
security for rich clients. Security was a priority over all - SSL was
used for communication
with external systems. Security was a priority for thin clients &#8211; all
communication
was encrypted with SSL between the browser and the web servers.
Scalability, maintainability
and extensibility were prioritized for the business logic tier. This
resulted
in the business tier having highly cohesive &amp; loosely coupled
modules. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
The rich client was designed to be a Java Swing application which would
directly communicate with the application server over RMI. SSL was not
used for
rich clients as the assumption was made that the Intranet will have
firewall(s)
protecting the application server from intrusion and the agents'
systems will
be able to interact without the performance burden of encryption.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
To further support scalability: business services (called facades &amp;
processors in the system design documents) were implemented as SLSBs.
Also
Entity EJBs were used with container managed persistence and
relationships.
Asynchronous messaging was used in the payment system to further boost
performance and scale - MDBs were used for this. Stateful beans were
minimized
and state maintenance was minimized on the business logic tier.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
To support maintainability and extensibility - the FBN architecture was
created
to be modular with loose coupling and high cohesion. The modules
provide
facades as entry points into the subsystem. Container managed
transactions and
entity beans were used to provide reliable transactions. The topology
and J2EE
server software vendor was required to support availability and
manageability.</p>

&amp; Simplifications<br>
</span></h3>
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
The following is a list of general business &amp; technical
assumptions:</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;"></span><i
 style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Business Assumptions</span><br>
</i>
<ul style="font-family: monospace;">
  <li>It is possible for an agent to act on the customer's behalf. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">(Note: "Customer" and "Agent" are
interchangeable in the diagrams.)</span><br>
  </li>
  <li>Seat availability is not guaranteed indefinitely i.e. no seat is
guaranteed until it is paid for.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Domain model is extensible i.e. the architect can extend the
domain model to establish the class diagram as long as no business
functionality is lost.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The itinerary will be persisted at the earliest possible time
even when the user has not signed in. It
will be associated with the user if the user is signed in - otherwise
it will time-out and removed. Also, the seats, when reserved, will be
booked - but will time-out if the
seat is not paid for.</li>
  <li>FBN will not directly support data maintenance of flight
inventory in the current scope because no use-cases were specified for
that. The inventory subsystem will be designed for extensibility.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Rich clients will be used exclusively from the Intranet region by
FBN Agents only.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: monospace; font-style: italic;">Note: More
detailed
assumptions are provided in the individual use-case design pages.</span><br>
<pre style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: monospace;"><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-family: monospace;"><br></span><i>Technical Assumptions</i></pre>
<ul style="font-family: monospace;">
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">The Award Miles System team
will
provide an XML-RPC interface to </span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">their system to support FBN's
integration.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span>An EJB container is
selected that can be tuned for performance of
CMP Entity Beans with CMR.</li>
  <li>Rich client is deployed on the Intranet which is in the server
protection domain and can
access the EJB-tier over RMI.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Client container is installed on all PCs used by agents and
delivery mechanism of FBN client code is automated.</li>
  <li>Required
well-known ports are available for rich clients to communicate over
RMI.</li>
  <li>The Intranet is considered secure therefore rich clients will not
need to communicate over SSL - this will promote better performance.</li>
  <li>The system will not detect the same user activity from multiple
clients. More than one session can be opened per client or multiple
across clients.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><span

For the purposes of effective
communication - the current mileage system will be referred to as
"Award
Miles System".</span><br>

 name="Design_Goals"></a>Design Goals</h3>
<i style="font-family: monospace;">The design goals are as follows:</i><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<ul style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">Satisfy all functional and
non-functional requirements.<br>
  </li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">Support multiple client types :
web browsers and Java Swing
clients.</li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">Module designs must aim to
support the open-closed principle, high cohesion and low coupling.<br>
  </li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">Use well-known design patterns
whenever possible because they are proven, tested and also helps
designers/developers productive quickly.<br>
  </li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">System must be
database, client, hardware, and
operating system agnostic.</li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">System design must completely
decouple presentation from business logic.</li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">System design must promote
separate developer roles based on
application tiers.</li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">Middleware will be implicit and
transparent to the developer.</li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">Limit clients to screen flow
control and heuristic data validation only.</li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">Do not expose entity object model
to the client (encapsulate it within the business tier).<br>
  </li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">Only the EJB tier to provide
business services.</li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">Transactions must support ACID
properties.</li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">Make business services stateless
to provide scalability.<br>
  </li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">Each type of client will have its
own controller.</li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">Clients must maintain their own
contextual session information whenever possible.<br>
  </li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">Decouple all tiers such that the
tiers should only connect with the next tier unidirectionally from
client tier to EIS tier.</li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">Separate the system into modules,
compose each module with logical components.<br>
  </li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">Provide at least one well known
entry-point into each subsystem via a facade.<br>
  </li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">Design to facilitate
verifiability and traceability. (Also a process
function).<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: monospace; font-style: italic;">The main goal
is to satisfy all functional requirements followed by non-functional
requirements (security, performance, scalability,
extensibility, reliability, maintainability, manageability &amp;
availability).</span><br

<h3

 name="Design_Choices__Decisions"></a>Design &amp; Technology Choices </h3>
<i style="font-family: monospace;">The following
design choices and decisions were made:</i><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<ul style="font-family: monospace;">
  <li>Java Swing was used to create the rich client application.</li>
  <li>JavaServer Pages technology (Servlets, TagLibs etc) were used for
the presentation tier for browser clients.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Entity EJBs - Container Managed Persistence, Container
Managed Relationships were used to support the Entity object model and
provide transparent persistence.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Message Driven EJBs &amp; Java Messaging Service were used to
support asynchronous messaging.</li>
  <li>Data Access Object pattern was used for custom queries that were
deemed too "heavy" for Entity Beans.</li>
  <li>Data Transfer Objects were used for accumulation of data from
data
access objects &amp; entity beans they are used for transfer data
between the business
&amp; client tiers. However as different clients need to represent data
in different ways - the DTOs were not coupled with the view - instead
each view has its own ValueBean - the command object maps (by using a
helper) the DTO to the
ValueBean of the specific client. This helps in decoupling clients from
the transfer objects and provides flexibility in data presentation.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Business Delegates were used to invoke business process calls
from
the client tier. Each client tier had its own business delegate which
knew how to connect and call business services.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Service Locator was used to locate &amp; get instances of EJBs.</li>
  <li>Stateless Session Beans - were used as facades into each business
segment (eg. payment).</li>
  <li>Local Stateless Session Beans - are called processors in the
system &amp; were often used to support the session facades. The
processors acts upon entities, data access objects etc
to perform
business functions. They also invoke facades of other subsystems to
complete business processing.</li>
  <li>Value List Handlers were used for searches to provide for future
extensibility and also to throttle or page the responses if required.</li>
  <li>Container managed transactions are to be started by the subsystem
facades (SLSBs).<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><a
 name="Design_Patterns_Used"></a>Design Patterns Used</h3>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Several design patterns were used
in the system , the significant patterns are listed below:</span><br>
<br>
<ul style="font-family: monospace;">
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Intercepting Filter</span> -
This is used for security sign-in checks for every request of FBN, it
will redirect to the sign-in screen if a user attempts to access
resources which need authorization.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Front Controller</span> - Used
to dispatch requests to appropriate helpers (commands) and redirect to
views. The request dispatcher is encapsulated within the controller and
managed via configuration files.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">View Helper</span> - Translates
the transfer object to the web JavaBeans
(value beans) used for rendering the view.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Command (Helper)</span> - The
Command pattern avatar of the J2EE Helper pattern was used. It provides
support for the screen flows, and access the business services via the
business delegates.<br>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Business Delegate <span
 style="font-weight: normal;">- Provides the mediator between the
client-tier(swing), web-tier and the ejb-tier.</span><br>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Session Facade - <span
 style="font-weight: normal;">This is the point of entry into a
sub-system - it abstracts the underlying mechanism of the sub-system
and provides a unified, simple api for business processes. All Session
Facades in the system end with the word 'facade'.&nbsp; The facade will
usually use a processor component (local SLSB) for business logic
processing.<br>
    </span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Service Locator - </span>Provided to
support finding services from the directory service (JNDI) is
streamlined and not repeated in code.<br>
    </span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Fast Lane Reader <span
 style="font-weight: normal;">- In order to provide read only data
without the over head of entity beans - this pattern was used, a
stateless session bean called the data access object directly which
created and returned a populated data transfer object back.</span><br>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Transfer Object Assembler <span
 style="font-weight: normal;">- This was used to accumulate data from
entity beans and various data transfer objects to create a 'clean'
transfer object. This has not been shown in the high level design
diagrams to avoid cluttering.</span><br>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Value List Handler -<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">This
pattern was used mostly because of the</span><br>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Data Access Object <span
 style="font-weight: normal;">- Accesses the underlying datastore &amp;
external systems, via JDBC &amp; XML-RPC respectively. It also creates
and populates data transfer objects</span><br>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Data Transfer Object <span
 style="font-weight: normal;">- Used to transfer data across tiers,
helps in encapsulating the system's domain objects from clients.</span><br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">Also Note:</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<ul style="font-family: monospace;">
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">The class diagram is J2EE
agnostic.It is an extension
of the business domain object
model. <br>
  </li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">The sequence diagrams are high
level and
J2EE agnostic. They show component interaction rather than object
interaction, as a result component creation, destruction are seldom
shown. All diagrams start with the
actors on the left-hand side and the business components on
the right - the flow is left to right &amp; top down. Important
stereotypes are used to provide clarity. Each
use-case has multiple sequence diagrams. Only
relevant components are shown.<br>
  </li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">The component diagram is a
high-level diagram , it is supported
by five detailed component diagrams for each subsystem.<br>
